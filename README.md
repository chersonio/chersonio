- 👋 Hi, I’m Stavros Chersoniotakis - I work as a full-stack C#/VB developer on a desktop app.
- 👀 I’m interested in building my portfolio so I can have a better understanding of programming using better and better tools to achieve deeper knowledge.
- 🌱 I attended an intensive seminar of 500 hrs of C# that included: Html/Css/Javascript, MS SQL, Angular, Node.js, React, ASP.NET, REST, MVC, Razor, Entity Framework and more. I attended Harvard's online seminar (Of David Malan) CS50X to refresh my developing skills in C.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on C# (and more) on a professional level.
- 📫 How to reach me: chersoniotakis.stavros@gmail.com
